Site that plays Animal Crossing music according to the time

### "**But wait!" you exclaim, "That's [already been made](http://tane.us/ac/)** (shoutout to **[Brian Lee](https://twitter.com/brianleewow)**)."

Yea but that uses Youtube, which downloads video data, even if it's just a tab you keep on in the background.
This site will be more akin to **[comeonandsl.am](http://comeonandsl.am)**, which autoplays the songs in an <audio> tag.

### "**But what's even the point?**"

My work has a 500 MB media data limit imposed per 24 hours while utilizing company bandwidth. I can stream a day's work of music fine, but videos are pretty limited. I can get through a few Binging with Babish episodes before RIP all my media for the rest of the day.

This is for people who have similar data restrictions as I do, but still want a good source of music in the background. Playing the same song for the entire session is grating, but AC's music is pleasant, eases into the background naturally, and the on-the-hour changes provide something fresh every so often so your brain doesn't focus too much on reptetive patterns while you're busy working away.

### "**But what about [Google's Autoplay Changes](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/09/autoplay-policy-changes)?**"

Fuckin' just have a play/pause button that starts the music it's not that hard.

### "**What's in it for you?**"
* **More practice building single-serving sites.** Because there are too many domains in the world and not enough websites.
* **Practice with audio processing.** There's no easy/simple audio sources that have the music tailored exactly how I want it. I'm going to have to figure out how to make these songs loop seamlessly between the hours, as well as process/loop them during the hours well enough that it doesn't distract the shit out of you.
* **I've had this idea in the back of my head for 2 years.** It's about time I get around to making it.

* Probably will be coded with **[Atom](https://atom.io)**.
* Probably will be hosted on an Amazon AWS S3 Bucket.
* Probably will be cert'd with **[Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)**.
* This is more of a *to-do* list than a *built-with* list but ¯\\_(ツ)\_/¯.
